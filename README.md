# Finite-element-method-for-space-time-fractional-diffusion-equation-solution
Finding solution of space time fractional diffusion equation using finite element method.

The aim of this project is to write computational solution to the diffusion equation characterizing spread, spatially and temporally in MATLAB.
To compute the numerical solution, the equation was discretized using Matrix Algebra and Finite Element Method. 
The diffusion equation used is from the paper "Finite element method for space-time fractional diffusion equation"
